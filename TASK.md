## Discovered During Work

### Technical Decisions Made
- **2025-01-25**: Chosen Vite + React + TypeScript stack based on HMR performance requirements
- **2025-01-25**: Selected Babel Standalone for runtime compilation to enable dynamic component generation
- **2025-01-25**: Decided on modular architecture with dependency injection for clean separation

### Dependencies Identified
- Core: `react`, `react-dom`, `typescript`, `vite`
- Compilation: `@babel/standalone`, `@babel/preset-react`
- Styling: `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/typography`
- State: `zustand`
- AI: Local Ollama instance with CodeLlama models
- Testing: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`
- Dev Tools: `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `eslint`, `prettier`

### Architecture Considerations
- File size limit: 500 lines per module maximum
- Security: All AI-generated code must run in sandboxed environments
- Performance: Target sub-50ms HMR update times
- Memory: Use WeakMap/WeakRef for automatic cleanup

## Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ 2025-01-25 - Project Planning Phase
- [x] Analyzed UI_MADNESS.md technical requirements
- [x] Analyzed Modern_Hot_Module_Replacement.md for HMR patterns
- [x] Created comprehensive project planning document
- [x] Established task tracking system
- [x] Defined development phases and milestones

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Create package.json** with all required dependencies
2. **Set up Vite configuration** with TypeScript and React
3. **Implement basic project structure** following modular patterns
4. **Create runtime JSX compiler** using Babel Standalone
5. **Build component registry** for managing dynamic components

## Blocked/Issues

*No current blockers identified*

## Notes

- Following SuperClaude v4.0.0 configuration for optimal development workflow
- Using TodoWrite tool for task management and progress tracking
- All code must include comprehensive TypeScript typing and JSDoc documentation
- Testing strategy focuses on unit tests for core functionality
- Security is paramount - no direct execution of AI-generated code without validation
